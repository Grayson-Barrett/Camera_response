# Camera_response
in this project I characterize my digital camera so that it can be used to estimate the XYZ values of imaged surfaces. For this project the imaged surface was a Macbeth ColorChecker. The accuracy of estimated camera XYZ's are then evaluated using a baseline of ColorMunki-measured XYZ values.
